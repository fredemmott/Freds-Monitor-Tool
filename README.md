NOT READY FOR USE. DO NOT USE.

## Support or Help

I make this for myself, and share it in case others find it useful; I do not currently have the time or energy for:

- help or support
- bug reports
- feature requests

This project is distributed as-is; no help or support is offered or available. **Do not ask the author for help, bug fixes, or features.**

### Bug Reports

See above.

### Feature Requests

See above.

It is reasonably likely that a future version will include a system tray feature; there is no ETA, news, or updates. Do not ask the author for ETA, news, or updates.

Small, standalone features (e.g. at the scale of 'extend to this new monitor') are likely to be accepted if [contributed](CONTRIBUTING.md).
